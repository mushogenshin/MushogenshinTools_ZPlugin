</p>

Allows for quickly changing the Polyframe display modes, where you can set a same hotkey and use it to cycle through four PF modes:

- Polyline only
- Polyfill only
- Polyline & Polyfill together
- No polyframe at all

## BG Cycling

Allows for quickly change the canvas background colors during sculpting for a better view. I personally set its hotkey to Alt + B, and cycling the four background colors just like I can in Maya!

## Force Toggle Sculptris

Last but not least, included in the ZPlugin is a button to “**Force Toggle Sculptris**”. This allows you to toggle Sculptris with ease of mind, where you don’t have to worry about turning off that `BackfaceMask` in `Brush >> AutoMasking` anymore.
